The goal of CitiesRopen is to provide an easy access to the Open Data Portal of the City of Konstanz [https://offenedaten-konstanz.de/]

## Installation

You can install the released version of CitiesRopen from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("CitiesRopen")
```

## Example

The package contains two major functions. You can use the Pipe-Operator ' %>% ' from margritter to combine them.


```{r cars, eval=FALSE}
show_data() %>% 
  get_data()
```

TBA. Those are some arguments to filter the output
